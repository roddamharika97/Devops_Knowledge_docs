VPC:

What are the different services u worked in aws?

EC2, s3.vpc, load balancer,IAM, auto-scaling

What is the difference between private subnet vs public subnet?

The instances in the public subnet can send outbound traffic directly to the internet, whereas the instances in the private subnet can't. Instead, the instances in the private subnet can access the internet by using a network address translation (NAT) gateway that resides in the public subnet. The database servers can connect to the internet for software updates using the NAT gateway, but the internet cannot establish connections to the database servers.


How do I get internet connectivity to the instances posted in private subnet?

You should use NAT gateway for connecting to internet from ec2-instances. NAT gateway is an AWS service, so it scales and reliable.
Go to the VPC dashboard
Create a NAT Gateway in the public subnet*. Ensure you are creating the NAT Gateway in public subnet only.
Attach an Elastic IP Address* to the NAT Gateway. Now a routing should be added to your private subnet
Go to private subnetâ€™s routing table.  Add a route to internet through NAT
Destination as 0.0.0.0/0 and Target as NAT gateway
And attach an internet gateway to the public subnet. And a routing 0.0.0.0/0 with target as internet gateway


Db servers are hosted in which subnet?

Private subnet.


What is natgateway & internet gateway?

Internet Gateway (IGW) allows instances with public IPs to access the internet.
NAT Gateway (NGW) allows instances with no public IPs to access the internet.


can one route associated with multiple oute tables or not?

Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a route table, which controls the routing for the subnet (subnet route table). You can explicitly associate a subnet with a particular route table. Otherwise, the subnet is implicitly associated with the main route table. A subnet can only be associated with one route table at a time, but you can associate multiple subnets with the same subnet route table.


Can 1 route table have multiple subnets or not?

You can explicitly associate a subnet with a particular route table. Otherwise, the subnet is implicitly associated with the main route table. A subnet can only be associated with one route table at a time, but you can associate multiple subnets with the same subnet route table.


What is vpc & its use cases?

With VPC, you can control inbound and outbound access for your resources in your own virtual private network and connect your data center with AWS cloud securely along with other VPCs in your AWS accounts and VPCs in other AWS accounts.


vpc components?

IPv4 and IPv6 address blocks.
Subnet creation.
Route tables.
Internet connectivity.
Elastic IP addresses (EIPs)
Network/subnet security.
Additional networking services.
